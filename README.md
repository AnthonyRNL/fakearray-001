# Fake Arrays

## Instructions
When you use certain gems you might notice that their main methods return "array like" objects.  What is an array like object?  Arrays respond to a set list of methods and behave in a certain fashion.  Because most Rubyists are so used to working with arrays, gem creators will often return objects that have the same methods defined on them as a regular array.  They will usually allow you to iterate over them (each) as well as indexing in using the [] method.  Create an object of your own that behaves in this manner.
